    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "### Normalizing Numerical Features\n",
    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners.

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "**Answer: **\n",
    "\n",
    "SVM:\n",
    "\n",
    "- SVM can be used in a variety of settings. The most recent application I can recall from my own project was for image recognition of handwritten numbers. A image of a handwritten number is essential a 2D array of 3-element lists, with each 3-element list representing a pixel of the image. The 3 elements forming the pixel are floats representing specific color assigned to each pixel. When combined together as a 2D array, the pixels can represent a image. We can create a list of 2D arrays representing each image and a list of labels, with each corresponding to the actual number each array represents. We can then train the model using the list of arrays and list of labels. After training, we can feed the model another list of 2D arrays that represent images of handwritten numbers, and it would accurately predict the numbers in those images.\n",
    "- Strength: SVM is good when we have a dataset with unstructured data. SVM uses kernel tricks to solve sometimes really complex problems. SVM also works relatively well to high dimensional data.\n",
    "- Weakness: One of the key weakness is training time. Since finding the right kernel is not easy, especially when the dataset is large. When the dataset is too large, the training time is extremely slow. The training parameters, like C and gamma, are hard to be tuned to optimal performance.\n",
    "- SVM is very good at classification of non-linear relationship as well as linear relationship. For our dataset, you can not be quite sure that the relationships between the features and income list have a clear linear relationship. SVM can perform transformations on the variables to higher dimensions and draw nonlinear boundries that will much better than simple linear boundaries. Even though the computation time may be an issue, our core purpose for this project is to find the best model to predict the outcome. Let's try SVM!\n",
    "\n",
    "Reference: https://community.alteryx.com/t5/Data-Science-Blog/Why-use-SVM/ba-p/138440\n",
    "\n",
    "AdaBoost:\n",
    "\n",
    "- In general, AdaBoost can be applied to many classification problems. I would use Spam Detection as an example. AdaBoost Model build a bunch of models and let the models vote for whether the coming email is spam or not. The votes are weighted according to the preassigned weights for each model. If the majority of the votes to to spam, the email would be classifed as spam.\n",
    "- Strength: Simple to implement, which gives short training time. Require less tweaking of hyperparameters than many other methods like SVM, but perform well in pratice. Resistant to overfitting(when noise is small).\n",
    "- Weaknesses: Needs a termination condition. \n",
    "- The reason to choose Adaboost is really because of its power in dealing with classification problems. Since our dataset is large, with many features after one-hot encoding, relying on a single prediction by one model may not be enough to accurately predict the outcomes. With adaboost model, we combine the results of many tree models and the law of large numbers would help us to make better predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reference: http://www.nickgillian.com/wiki/pmwiki.php/GRT/AdaBoost\n",
    "\n",
    "Gradient Boosting:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Gradient Boosting can also be applied in various settings. It is known for the application in anomaly detection in highly unbalanced datasets, such as DNA sequences. \n",
    "- Strength: The predictive quality often beats other methods. Gradient Boosting has the abiltity to solve all kinds of objective function that has gradients, which is harder to achieve using other methods. Gradient Boosting also works great with categorical and numerical values.\n",
    "- Disadvantage: Lack of interpretability. Tend to overfit if the inappropriate hyperparameters are used. The training time maybe slower than other methods like the Adaboost.\n",
    "- Due to the large number of features we have in our dataset, the optimization functions are usually complicated. Gradient Boosting is good at solving complex optimization problems. Also, since there is both categorical data and numerical data in the dataset we originally had, gradient boosting also makes sense given its ability to deal with both kinds of data.\n",

    "**Answer**: \n",
    "Based on the graphs, we decided to choose the Gradient Boosting Classifier is the most appropriate model for the task of identifying individuals that make more than $50,000. There are three primary reasons. \n",
    "\n",
    "- F score with a 0.5 beta, which emphasize precision more than recall, is the highest for Gradient Boosting when 100% of the training set is used. This shows that Gradient Boosting is the best model out of the three models in terms of precisely predicting individuals with more than $50,000 of earnings. This is really important to the organization, because the cost to spread out information and contact potential donors is high, and a high precision model can improve our chances of getting fund while lowering the cost of getting funds.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The prediction time and training time is also crucial, since we want to lower the computational cost as much as possible, as the organization proceeds and get more and larger datasets, we want to be able to train the model with less time and power so that when new data comes in, we can improve our model by training it at faster rate and at lower cost. We also want the prediction time to be low. As the organization grow, we will need much more donation from the public in the future. We want to be able to filter out our potential donors faster as the amount of data coming in grows. Based on our observation of the above three models, Adaboost and Gradient Boosting have much less training time compared to SVM classifier. We eliminate SVM in this round given its enormous amount of time to train and predict, and its relatively low accuracy score and f-beta scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Suitability for the data depends on whether the model fits the data well. This can be reflected by the trend of training and testing scores (-errors) as the training set size increases. A just right model would training and testing scores converge to each other to a high value as the training set size increases. This is the case for both Gradient Boosting and Adaboosting classifiers, as both f-beta scores and accuracy scores for training and testing sets converge to a relatively high value (around 0.85 for accuracy score and 0.7 for f-beta score). This was not the case for SVM, where we can barely see a pattern and the scores are generally lower than scores of the other two models. \n",
    "\n",
    "Overall we observe that both Adaboost Classifier and Gradient Boosting Classifier would be good models to accurately identify individuals that make more than $50,000. Even though Adaboost has shorter training time, we would still pick Gradient Boosting as our final model, given that its training time is not unacceptable (less than 10 seconds for the full training set). On the other hand, Gradient Boosting really has an edge in terms of precision, as reflected by the f-beta scores. This advantage will benefit the organization a lot going forward.\n"

    "**Answer:** \n",
    "\n",
    "The final model we chose is called Gradient Boosting Model. This model is strong in a sense that, like a human beings, it values team work. The model combines a group of weak models, assigning to each of them a portion of the task that they are capable of doing. The combination of the team becomes an extremely strong model that barely makes mistakes.\n",
    "\n",
    "How is the model trained? When the model is given a set of data about a group of individuals, the model start with contruction of a \"weak\" learner, meaning that, even though the first learner tries its best to learn as much as possible, it is hard to make an accurate prediction just by itself. The first \"weak\" learner asks the question, \"which characteristic is the most important in determining whether or not someone makes more than 50000 dollars?\" Then the model finds the best threshold of that characteristic and split the data into two by that threshold. For example, if number years of education is the most important charateristic, the model tries find a certain number of years of education as cutoff point and predict that everyone who has more than that number of years of education is making more than 50000 dollars, and everyone else is making less than 50000 dollars. The model would find an optimal cutoff point such that the prediction that follow would make the least errors. Then the first \"weak\" learner would repeat this process and ask, \"which charateristic is the second most important?\" and split the two regions further to more regions by the best cutoff points. The model repeat itself and eventually stop after doing this a couple times. Then the model test the first \"weak\" learner by the data you previously gave it. When the information of a individual comes in, the model first put this individual into a region according to his or hear information. Then the model make a prediction about this individual based on the the majority of the individuals in that region. For instance, if the majority of the people makes more than 50000 dollars in the region, we would predict that this individual, whose information belongs to this region, is also making more than 50000 dollars. \n",
    "\n",
    "After making predictions about the whole data set, the model finds out that this \"weak\" learner makes some mistakes, and it measures the amount of mistakes it made for each individual and record them. Then, the model construct another \"weak\" learner. This time, instead of learning whether or not each individal makes more than 50000 dollars or not, the \"weak\" learner wants to learn about the amount of mistake the first \"weak\" learner makes about each individual. To do this, the new \"weak\" learner adopt the same method as the first \"weak\" learner, splitting the data into many regions. After constructing the new learner, the model again tests the \"weak\" learners. This time, however, the prediction is made by the two \"weak\" learners combined. The first learner makes the same predictions as before, and then, the second \"weak\" learner also group the all individuals into its own regions based on their information. Then, for each individual, the second \"weak\" learner calculates the average error that the first \"weak\" learner makes about the individuals who belong to that region, and adjust the original prediction made by the first \"weak\" learner by adding or substracting that error to the prediction to form a new, adjusted prediction. By the combination of the forces of the two \"weak\" learners, the whole model makes less mistakes than before, but still some mistakes. Then the model construct a third \"weak\" learner that help adjust the mistakes made by first two \"weak\" learners, a fourth \"weak\" learner that adjust the mistakes made by the first three \"weak\" learners and so on. Eventually, the number of \"weak\" learners reaches our limit. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, when a new data of an individual comes in. The model first makes a prediction using the first \"weak\" learner. Then it uses the second \"weak\" learner the adjust the prediction made by the first \"weak\" learner. After that, the model uses the third \"weak\" learner to adjust prediction made by the first two \"weak\" learners. Each \"weak\" learner brings the final prediction one step closer to the true target value of the individual, in our case, \"this person makes more than $50000 or not.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "However, when we train this model, we usually don't want it to become too familiar with people we have in our original data that it forgets the existence of people outside of our data. We want the model to be trained just enough for us to predict whether someone makes more than 50000 dollars given information of anyone in the future. In the next section, we will adjust the model so that it works the best.\n",

    "- Import [`sklearn.grid_search.GridSearchCV`](http://scikit-learn.org/0.17/modules/generated/sklearn.grid_search.GridSearchCV.html) and [`sklearn.metrics.make_scorer`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.make_scorer.html).\n",
    "- Initialize the classifier you've chosen and store it in `clf`.\n",
    " - Set a `random_state` if one is available to the same state you set before.\n",
    "- Create a dictionary of parameters you wish to tune for the chosen model.\n",
    " - Example: `parameters = {'parameter' : [list of values]}`.\n",
    " - **Note:** Avoid tuning the `max_features` parameter of your learner if that parameter is available!\n",
    "- Use `make_scorer` to create an `fbeta_score` scoring object (with $\\beta = 0.5$).\n",
    "- Perform grid search on the classifier `clf` using the `'scorer'`, and store it in `grid_obj`.\n",

    "- 1. capital-gain: Capital gain is realized most often when a person has assets. More capital gain usually indicates more assets owned by a person. A person would not buy assets if he or she does not make enough money to cover the daily costs he or she spends everyday. Therefore, I would say the more capital gain a person has, the more assets he or she is likely to have and more likely this person already makes more than $50000.\n",
    "\n",
    "- 2. education_num: The number of years of education is usually positive correlated to a person's income. The more education a person gets, the more skills a person is supposed to have, and the more competitive he or she will be in the job market. Thus a person who has more years of education is more likely to make more than $50000.\n",
    "\n",
    "- 3. education: Almost the same reason as \"education_num.\" A person who has a Bachelors degree is more likely to have more skills than someone who only has a Preschool education, and therefore more likely to make more than $50000. The only thing I would worry about is the correlation between education and education_num. \n",
    "\n",
    "- 4. Age: two primary reasons for age. First, elder employees are often more experienced at their works, and therefore likely to get paid better. Second, elder employees tend to have stayed in a job for a longer time, and have climbed the corporate ladder to make more money. I think people who have higher age are more likely to make more than $50000\n",
    "\n",
    "- 5. Marital-status: Marriage can give people more responsibilities, and therefore propel them to work harder and make more money. On the other hand, people usually start off their careers unmarried. Once their careers stablize, people start to think about marriage. People with more stablized careers tend to make more than people who just starts off."

    "- The five features are mostly in line with the inital guesses I discussed, except for \"capital-loss\" and \"hours-per-work\", which I did not include as one of my inital guesses. \"Education\"  and \"Martial status\" did not appear in the final 5 features, but I included it as my initial guess. \n",
    "- I think \"capital-loss\" may have similar effect as \"capial-gain\". When a person owns many assets, his or her investments don't usually pay off as well as they think. Thus some investments may result in capital loss instead of capital gain. However, having large capital loss also indicates the fact that the individual owns many assets to generate those losses, which also indicates that the individual makes a lot to buy those assets.\n",
    "- The reason that \"education\" did not appear in the final five is somewhat stronge, but I think that perhaps \"educatin-num\" has similar effect as \"education\"\n",
    "- \"hours-per-week\" is important because in many jobs, income or wage is tied to the number of hours the employees work per week. The more hours they work, the more income they earn. I did not include this because I thought many high-paying jobs may not require people to have long work hours. The companies would focus on the personal health and mental health for those key employees. It turns out this might not be the case."

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "

    "- When only five most important features are used, the performace of our best model is slightly worse than before. The accuracy store decreased slightly from 0.8700 to 0.8430, while the Fbeta-score with beta = 0.5 also decreased slightly from 0.7510 to 0.7004. The reason that the performance is still almost as good as the performance of our model using all features is that the five features selected are often more often used as split points for the trees, and therefore they tend to be the determinants for the whether the individual makes more than $50000. \n",
    "- When training time is a factor, the reduced data is perhaps a good idea, as the training for five features is just a tiny portion of the training time for full features. (12.144 vs 1.475) At the same time, the performance is only slightly compromised. "
